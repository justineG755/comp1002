        <h3>Setting up</h3>
        <p><strong>Here is a Step by Step on setting up and using the camera:</strong></p>
       
        1. Open the Camera (if foldable)
        If your camera folds, pull the top up until it clicks into place.

        2. Load the Film
        The camera will not function without a film pack installed, as the film pack provides the power.
        Open the film door, slide the film pack in, and close it.
        The camera will push out the black cover sheet on its own.

        3. Wait for the Flash to Charge
        The built-in flash will automatically begin charging once the camera is opened or film is loaded.
        Give it a few seconds, most models show a small light when it’s ready.

        4. Take the Picture
        Look through the viewfinder, hold the camera steady, and press the button.
        The photo will come out right away.

        5. Let the Photo Develope
        Keep the picture out of bright light and don’t shake it.
        It will fully develop in about 10–15 minutes.


        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

        Photo is too dark
        The picture might have been taken in low light. Try standing somewhere brighter or let the flash charge fully before taking the photo.

        Photo is too bright
        This can happen when shooting directly toward a bright light or window. Try changing your angle.

        Flash isn't working
        The battery for the camera is inside the film pack. If the flash doesn’t charge, the film pack might be old or out of power.

        Photo comes out black or white
        This can happen if the film is expired or wasn’t stored properly. Try using a fresh pack of film.

        Lines or streaks on the photo
        Sometimes the rollers inside the camera get dusty. Wipe them gently with a cloth and try again.
        
        Film is jammed
        May mean the film pack wasn’t inserted correctly. Open the film door, remove the pack, then re insert it and close the door.


        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        How long does a photo take to develop?
        Usually around 10–15 minutes.

        Do I need batteries for the camera?
        No. The battery is inside the film pack.

        Can I shake the photo?
        It’s better not to — leave it still while it develops.

        Why is my flash slow to charge?
        The flash depends on the battery in the film. If it’s old, it may take longer.

        How should I store my film?
        Keep it in a cool, dry place and away from heat.
